# yw-gui
Graphical interface for rending graphs produced by YesWorkflow

Overview
--------

The GUI's purpose is to provide users an interactive ability to customize their own scripts as well as view a graphical representation of their script.

Currently the GUI allows the user to view what files are in the current working directory that the main_ui file is located in. From here, the user can indicate a file for a yw command to be run upon. 
The current supported yw commands from the GUI are the graph, extract, and the help (-h) function.


Running (Windows supported right now)
-------

To run the GUI from your computer, ensure that PyQt4 is installed properly and then navigate to the correct folder and then simply run the command
python main_ui.py
